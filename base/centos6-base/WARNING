WARNING

CentOS 6.x is END OF LIFE - you should not use this for anything except limited, *network-disabled* applications.

Beware of other security risks that may be inherent in using old, vulnerable libraries and applications.

### Why include this then?

Because some applications only run in older, unsupported versions of operating systems and they're fun to tool around with
for either entertainment or historical reasons.
